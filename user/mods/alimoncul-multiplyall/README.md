## MultiplyALL

This mod dynamically multiplies the values listed in config and doesn't change any files in the database. The benefit of this you don't need to do anything after each SPT release, this mod will do everything for you. Just change the multipliers inside of config.json.

Configs:
Open up MOD_FOLDER/config.json and you will see the values and descriptions. Don't go too much of course I don't know the limit but if you want to disable an option just write down 1 for the value. If the value is 1 it doesn't change anything for that part.

How to Install:
Download the release zip and unzip it. Copy the content of the unzip folder (AlimOncul-MultiplyALL-X.X.X) and paste it into your SPT_FOLDER/user/mods. Final result should look like this:
